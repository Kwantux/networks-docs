Networks is a Minecraft plugin for Paper, that allows you to create fully automatic sorting systems easily.

You can define input containers, set filters to sorting containers and let unrecognized items flow into miscellaneous containers.

This makes it much more performant and easier than regular redstone based sorting systems, while still staying vanilla style.

You can download the plugin at [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/plugin/networks) or [Hangar](https://hangar.papermc.io/Kwantux/Networks)
