Input containers have a limited range they can transfer items to.
You can increase this range by crafting antennas and placing them on the input container.

Please note that antennas won't have any effect if the target container is in an unloaded chunk.
If you want to allow this though, read the [config](config) page under the performance section.

An input container starts with tier 0. You are able to apply the upgrades after first applying onto a placed input container.
The upgrades need to be applied in order from 1 to the number you want to have. For example to have infinite range you first apply tier 1 then tier 2 then tier 3 then tier 4 then tier 5.

The crafting recipes for the upgrades can be found in the recipe book at the crafting table.

### Default
- Range = 25m (Base range)

### Tier 1
- Does not require any tier below
- Range = 75m (Base range + 50m)

### Tier 2
- Requires tier 1 to be installed on the input container
- Range = 125m (Base range + 100m)

### Tier 3
- Requires tier 2 to be installed on the input container
- Range = 525m (Base range + 500m)

### Tier 4
- Requires tier 3 to be installed on the input container
- Range = Infinite in the same world

### Tier 5
- Requires tier 4 to be installed on the input container
- Range = Infinite + Interdimensional

## Configuration

You can configure the base range and the range per tier.
You can also add/remove tiers.
And if you want, you can make it, so that range upgrades are network wide not just per container.

More information can be found in the [config](config) page.
