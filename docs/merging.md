You have multiple networks, but you later decided, that you want them as one without manually breaking and replacing all components?  
  
You can use the `/net merge <net1> <net2>` command.

This will merge net2 into net1.

The final network will have the name of net1, the components of both and the higher upgrade tier from both.

  
In order to use it, you need to be owner of both networks. If you want to merge your network with one of your friend, one of you needs to [transfer the network's ownership](/users.md) to the other.
