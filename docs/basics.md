To create a storage network, simply run `/net create <name>`

`<name>` is the ID of your network, you will need it to edit your network.

Every network on the server has its own unique ID.

To perform any changes, you first need to select your network using `/net select <name>`

This is needed to place new network components or add new users.

If you wish to delete your network, simply run `/net delete <name>`

You will be asked to confirm this action using `/net delete <name> confirm`

**But be careful: This action is not reversible!**
