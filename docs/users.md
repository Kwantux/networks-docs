Without any other plugins, ALL players can open your network's chests and take items out of it.

If you wish that only certain player are able to access them, just use any other claim plugin.

However, only network users can break components and add new ones.

To give other players access to editing your network, add them using `/net user add <player>`

In case you want to revoke their access, use `/net user remove <player>`

Only the owner of a network can add and remove users.

If you want to transfer the ownership of a network, you can use `/net owner <player>`
