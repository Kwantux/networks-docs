Without any other plugins, ALL players can open your network's chests and take items out of it.

If you wish that only certain player are able to access them, just use any other claim plugin.

However, only the network owner can break components and add new ones.

To give other players access to editing your network, add them using `/net user add <player>`

In case you want to revoke their access, use `/net user remove <player>`

If you want to transfer the ownership of a network (For example if you want to merge two networks owned by different players), you can use `/net owner <player>`
